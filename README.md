# MySite

The site will ultimatly provide recuiters with short videos and pictures of personal projects that I have completed to increase my tech stack in my personal time. In addition, this site will be used to provide my personal clients with a central place to not only see some of the work that I have done on my own time but see some of the clients I have worked with to provide them with more insight of my skills as a developer. I will also have a reviews page in the site to allow people to rate my work.
